1. What does it mean when we say javascript is asynchronous?

Javascript will continue to run, top to bottom, even if that means having to wait on certain details to be filled in later.

2. What are javascript promises?

Javascript promises are a tool that we use to asynchronously continue a program that is waiting on that promise to be fufilled.

3. What does it mean when a promise resolves?

When a promise resolves, the result of whatever function that was called on has returned something.

4. What does it mean when a promise rejects?

When a project rejects, it usually means that there was an error. 

5. Explain the use of .then() on promises

Using .then() allows us to dictate what we do with the result of the promise.

6. 5. Explain the use of .catch() on promises

Using .catch() let's us control what happens if there is an error.

7. Explain the use of .finally() on promises

Using .finally() seems to be like a extra call that's run when the function gets called almost like a flag.

8. Explain async functions and how async/await are used.

Async/await works on the same logic as the .then() syntax. It allows a function to be called asynchronously and then the await term acts like the .then() and allows us to give instructions on how to used the returned payload.

9. Provide one example of how promises can be used.

I've used promises a good bit when making fetch requests to API's.
